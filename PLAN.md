Team Members:
* Hugo Thompson
* Harvey Francois
* Marta Deneke
* Danny Castro

## Cooperation Plan

### Hugo
#### Strengths
* I feel confident about javascript and on a social side I feel confident in working with the team.
#### How I can use them
* Try to help other members of the team when they need it and always be ready to dive into the backend!
#### Professional Weakness
* I am somewhat of a procrastinator at times and I want to be better at not putting of tasks for myself.

### Marta
#### Strengths
* I am organized and good at keeping things organized
* I am a good learner
#### How I can use them
* Keeping the team on track with agile, organize tasks
#### Professional Weakness
* I usually work on my own, but I'm noticing that it's needed to work in groups for this industry. Because of that, I want to build that skill.

### Harvey
#### Strengths
* I am comfortable with javascript. I'm friendly, and I keep morale high.
#### How I can use them
* Contribute where I can
#### Professional Weakness
* I haven't had much experience working as a team, so I hope to get better at it and improve my teamwork skills

### Danny
#### Strengths

* I am more comfortable with css and the design/ux, in a team I'm an easygoing and friendly fellow! I really like motivating others.
* I'm good at googling!

#### How I can use them

* Help gel the whole team together with motivation and excitement, and bless the project with my css skills.

#### Professional Weakness

* Organizational! I'm a creative at heart so I see what sticks, but that means I don't plan too far ahead.

## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

* Meeting up at the start of the workday, catching up on what was done and what needs to be done, managing the trello
* Delegate tasks, assign them to the tasks on trello

### Work style: Work solo, speak up if you need help and meet back as a group discussion in intervals

## Conflict Plan 

>Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

1. Two people disagree on something
2. Bring the others into the discussion to hear what they have to say
3. Compromise, if possible agree to disagree can keep productivity
4. If we really can't agree on something and we can't compromise on it, then we can run a "Hands up if you're okay with this, hands up if you're okay with that" deal

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

1. Identifying when that point actually is, making sure that tasks are delegated on the trello
2. Enforce the trello- we HAVE to delegate tasks

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Planning is a huge part of making sure those behind on skill level can keep up with what is happening in the project, and the second important key is for those ahead to be active in helping those behind in understanding the concepts the project is using.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

(Keeping in mind we assign trello tasks to everyone to split the workload)

Support. If someone is falling behind on their trello tasks, we need to be sure to come in and make sure they get the help they need in finishing and catching up. We can adjust the amount of trello tasks someone gets so they're comfortable with their workload, and switch to pilot/navigator system for them on a task to help teach it.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If all else fails: Group discussion is key. Talk about what we are not compromising on, and find something in the center. At some point we have to decide we've debated something long enough, we need to just move forward unfortunately.

## Communication Plan

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
  * From when class starts to 9:30 pm, We're present
* What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  * Be in remo when you should be, and have slack on your phone for off hours
* How often will you take breaks?
  * 15 minutes, if you're still stuck then ask others
  * 10 minute break every hour, if class starts at 6:30 then break at 7:30, 8:30, and we're disbanding at 9:30
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  * See above, don't be afraid to ask.
  * If we're falling behind on a team level, then we'll start meeting in remo on off days
  * Revisit the scope of the project, cut features, retask people, get back up to speed
* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  * Have slack on your phone and we should be able to reach eachother!
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  * First meetup of the day, everyone addresses their comments and concerns
  * Maintaining psychological safety and that means keeping a friendly group
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  * Keep it casual
  * Keep the comments professional
  * Need to know when to joke around and when to be full serious!

## Work Plan

> Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

* How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  * Trello! Trello seems to be a system we're all pretty happy with as far as keeping tasks assigned and handled
* What project management tool will be used?
  * **TRELLO**

## Git Plan

* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  * The project itself is on the remote repository
* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  * Add them as collaborators
* What is your Git flow?
  * Team members can clone the repository initially, then for each task they will: Branch off of main, make changes, commit changes (you can commit as much as you want for the tasks). Pushed back to origin on the remote repository, where the tasks will be PR'd and reviewed by another team member.
* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  * How many people must review a PR?
    * 2 People who aren't the creator of the PR.
  * Who merges PRs?
    * The aforementioned reviewer.
  * How often will you merge?
    * Just as it is necessary.
  * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    * It's cool to merge whenever, because github will not let you merge a merge conflicted pr.
